Sentiment Analysis using RNN and FFNN
=====================================

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) on the IMDB movie review dataset.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to implement and compare the performance of RNN and FFNN models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.

**Dataset:**
The IMDB dataset is a collection of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

**Models:**

### RNN Model

* Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras
* Consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense output layer
* Trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss

### FFNN Model

* Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras
* Consists of an embedding layer, two dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations, respectively
* Trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss



**Requirements:**

* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras 2.x
* Python 3.x
